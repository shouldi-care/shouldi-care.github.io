## The Questions

**Criminal:** If a company's website says you can do something, and you do it, and your lawyer refuses to show the jury that website... is that justice?

**Medical:** If a hospital bills for a physician who never saw the patient, and holds that patient for law enforcement after medical clearance... is that healthcare?

**Marital:** If your co-defendant wife recommended your lawyer, and that lawyer buried evidence that would free you both, and she got probation while you got prison... was it a marriage or a setup?
