# Document 06: Sentencing Disparity

## The Defendants

| Defendant | Relationship | Charges | Verdict | Sentence |
|-----------|--------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Matthew Channon | Husband | Wire fraud, conspiracy | Guilty (jury) | **Federal prison** |
| Brandi Channon | Wife | Wire fraud, conspiracy | Guilty (jury) | **Probation only** |

---

## The Disparity

Both defendants were:
- Charged with the same crimes
- Tried together
- Found guilty by the same jury
- Sentenced by the same judge

Yet one received prison. One received probation.

---

## Possible Explanations

### 1. Cooperation
Brandi Channon may have cooperated with the government in exchange for leniency. Evidence suggesting this:
- Her attorney (Hotchkiss) filed 10 notices of unavailability at strategic times
- She never testified at trial (cooperators typically don't)
- Both defense attorneys attended the meeting where exculpatory evidence was shown - then neither used it
- The timeline suggests advance knowledge of the FBI raid

### 2. Gender Disparity
Federal sentencing statistics show women receive shorter sentences than men for equivalent crimes. However, prison vs. probation is an extreme difference.

### 3. Role in Offense
The government may have argued Matthew was the leader and Brandi was a minor participant. However:
- They were charged jointly on most counts
- The jury found both guilty
- If Brandi was truly minor, why charge her at all?

---

## The Uncomfortable Question

If Brandi cooperated with the government, what did she provide?

If she provided testimony or information that helped convict Matthew, why wasn't that testimony presented at trial?

If she provided something else - information about the exculpatory evidence, agreement to help suppress it, coordination with defense counsel - that would explain both the disparity and the buried defense.

# Document 07: Transcripts "Filed in Error"

## Source
PACER Docket, 1:13-cr-966 (D.N.M.)

---

## The Anomaly

Eight trial transcripts (Documents 306-313) were marked **"FILED IN ERROR"** on the PACER docket.

They were subsequently replaced with new transcripts (Documents 422-430, 433).

---

## The Documents

| Original | Status | Replacement | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Doc 306 | Filed in error | Doc 422 | 1-11-16 evidentiary hearing |
| Doc 307 | Filed in error | Doc 423 | 1-13-16 "Volume 1" jury selection |
| Doc 308 | Filed in error | Doc 424 | |
| Doc 309 | Filed in error | Doc 425 | |
| Doc 310 | Filed in error | Doc 426 | |
| Doc 311 | Filed in error | Doc 427 | |
| Doc 312 | Filed in error | Doc 429 | |
| Doc 313 | Filed in error | Doc 430, 433 | **Verdict day - TWO replacements** |

---

## Irregularities

### 1. Doc 428 is Missing
Between Doc 427 and Doc 429, there is no Doc 428. It simply doesn't exist on the docket.

### 2. Two Verdict Day Transcripts
The verdict day transcript (originally Doc 313) was replaced by BOTH Doc 430 AND Doc 433. Two different documents for the same proceeding, with different costs listed.

### 3. Certification Date Anomaly
One of the original transcripts (Doc 306) reportedly had a certification date of December 31, 2015 - for a hearing that occurred on January 11, 2016. The transcript was certified before the hearing happened.

### 4. 71 Missing Document Numbers
The docket has 71 document numbers with no corresponding entry. Documents simply don't exist for those numbers.

---

## Questions

1. What was different between the original transcripts and the replacements?
2. Why were ALL EIGHT marked as filed in error simultaneously?
3. Why is Doc 428 missing?
4. Why are there two verdict day replacement transcripts?
5. What did the originals contain that required replacement?

# Document 08: The $81,000 vs. $2,000,000 Discrepancy

## Source
Gardner (OfficeMax) settlement letter, June 2011
Government's trial claims, January 2016

---

## The Numbers

| Source | Amount | Date |
|--------|--------|------|
| OfficeMax settlement letter | **$81,000** | June 2011 |
| Government's trial allegation | **$2,000,000+** | January 2016 |

---

## Significance

Gardner, the OfficeMax representative who investigated the alleged fraud, wrote a settlement demand letter in June 2011 assessing damages at $81,000.

Four and a half years later, the government claimed fraud exceeding $2,000,000.

The loss amount increased by **24x** between the victim's own assessment and the government's prosecution.

---

## Why This Matters

Federal wire fraud sentencing is driven by loss amount:
- Higher alleged loss = longer sentence
- $81,000 loss = significantly lower sentencing guidelines
- $2,000,000 loss = significantly higher sentencing guidelines

The judge explicitly gave defense counsel permission to cross-examine Gardner about this discrepancy. This was a major impeachment opportunity.

The cross-examination on this point was minimal.

# Document 09: Hotchkiss Unavailability Pattern

## Source
PACER Docket, 1:13-cr-966 (D.N.M.)

---

## The Pattern

Todd Hotchkiss, attorney for co-defendant Brandi Channon, filed **10 notices of unavailability** throughout the case.

These notices appeared at strategic moments in the litigation.

---

## Significance

Notices of unavailability delay proceedings. When filed strategically, they can:
- Push hearings past critical deadlines
- Allow time for coordination
- Delay discovery or disclosures
- Extend the case timeline

Filing 10 such notices is unusual. The pattern of when they were filed - and what they delayed - warrants examination.

---

## Contrast

Hotchkiss remained Brandi's attorney throughout the entire case, from arraignment through appeals.

Matthew Channon went through multiple attorneys:
- Don Kochersberger (initial, recommended by Brandi)
- Dave Streubel (partner who quit day of arraignment)
- Amy Sirignano (CJA, withdrew citing cancer)
- Marc Robert (FPD lead)
- John Robbenhaar (FPD second chair)

The stability of Brandi's representation vs. the instability of Matthew's is notable.
