# Document 03: Original Judgment - "Pleaded Guilty"

## Source
PACER, Document 377
USA v. Channon, 1:13-cr-966 (D.N.M.)
Filed: [October 2016]

## The Error

The original judgment entered by the court stated that Matthew Channon **"pleaded guilty"** to the charges.

This was false.

Matthew Channon went to trial. He was found guilty by a jury after a multi-day trial. He never entered a guilty plea.

## Significance

A judgment is the official record of a conviction. It determines:
- The basis for imprisonment
- The record that follows you for life
- The foundation for any appeal

A judgment that says "pleaded guilty" when the defendant went to trial is not a clerical error - it's a fundamentally different proceeding with different constitutional protections.

**A guilty plea waives:**
- Right to jury trial
- Right to confront witnesses
- Right to present a defense

**A jury trial preserves all of these rights.**

If the judgment says "pleaded guilty," it implies none of those trial rights were exercised - or needed to be protected.

## Questions This Raises

1. How does a court enter a judgment with the wrong conviction basis?
2. Who caught the error?
3. Why was it corrected so quickly (3 days)?
4. Were there other errors in the judgment?
5. What does the original judgment for co-defendant Brandi Channon say?

# Document 04: Amended Judgment - "Found Guilty by Jury"

## Source
PACER, Document 379
USA v. Channon, 1:13-cr-966 (D.N.M.)
Filed: [3 days after Document 377]

## The Correction

Three days after the original judgment was entered, an amended judgment was filed.

The amended judgment changed **"pleaded guilty"** to **"found guilty by jury verdict."**

## What Changed

| Field | Original (Doc 377) | Amended (Doc 379) |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Conviction basis | Pleaded guilty | Found guilty by jury verdict |
| Filing date | [Date] | [Date + 3 days] |

---

## Questions

1. Was this the only change, or were other modifications made?
2. Who requested the amendment?
3. Is there a motion on the docket requesting correction?
4. Did the same error appear in co-defendant Brandi Channon's judgment (Doc 378 → 380)?

---

## Pattern

This error - if it was an error - fits a pattern of document irregularities in this case:
- 8 transcripts marked "filed in error" and replaced
- Document 428 missing entirely from the docket
- Two different verdict-day transcripts with different costs
- 71 missing document numbers in the docket sequence
