## Significance

### The Appointment Came:
- **3 years** after Robbenhaar refused to present exculpatory evidence
- **2 months** after Channon filed habeas petition challenging his representation
- **~2 weeks** before Channon surrendered to begin his prison sentence

### Unusual Career Path

Federal Public Defenders rarely become federal judges. The typical career paths are:
- Remain in public defense
- Move to private criminal defense practice
- Academia

Appointment to the federal bench - even as a magistrate - is an unusual reward for a public defender.

### The Question

Was this appointment:
- A coincidence?
- A reward for services rendered?
- An inducement to maintain silence about trial irregularities?

## What Happened to the 2255 Petition

After the habeas petition was filed alleging ineffective assistance of counsel:

1. Both Marc Robert (lead counsel) and John Robbenhaar resigned from representing Channon
2. They resigned rather than respond to the allegations
3. Robbenhaar was appointed magistrate shortly thereafter

## Note on Recusal

As a sitting magistrate in the District of New Mexico, Robbenhaar would be required to recuse himself from any matters involving:
- Matthew Channon
- Cases raising similar ineffective assistance issues
- Any matter where his impartiality could reasonably be questioned

Whether such recusal has occurred in practice is unknown.
