## The Text

The OfficeMax MaxPerks website included a feature allowing users to manually add receipts to claim rewards. The webpage for this feature contained the following language:

> **"enter the numbers for a transaction you did not make with your rewards card"**

This text appeared on the official OfficeMax website, visible to all MaxPerks users, during the entire period of alleged fraudulent activity (August 2009 - June 2011).

## Legal Significance

### Wire Fraud (18 USC 1343) Requires:
1. A scheme to defraud
2. Material misrepresentation  
3. Intent to deceive

### This Language Negates All Three Elements:

**No scheme to defraud**: The company explicitly invited users to claim transactions they didn't make. Following published instructions is not a "scheme."

**No material misrepresentation**: The user did exactly what the website said they could do. There was no false statement - OfficeMax knew users could enter others' transactions because OfficeMax told them they could.

**No intent to deceive**: A person who follows a company's published instructions cannot have intent to deceive that company. The conduct was authorized.

## The Defense That Never Was

This evidence was:
- Captured from Archive.org
- Prepared as a posterboard exhibit
- Shown to defense counsel the night before cross-examination of OfficeMax's witness
- **Never presented to the jury**

Instead, defense counsel attempted a vague "Apple Terms of Service" argument (that nobody reads terms and conditions), which was immediately objected to and dropped.

The jury never saw that OfficeMax's website authorized the exact conduct the government called fraud.
