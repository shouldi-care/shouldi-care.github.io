## Statement

I, Matthew Channon, declare under penalty of perjury:

### The Evening of January 18, 2016

On the evening before Day 4 of my federal criminal trial, after court had adjourned, I met with:

- **John Robbenhaar** (my second-chair Federal Public Defender)
- **Todd Hotchkiss** (co-defendant Brandi Channon's attorney)
- **A Federal Public Defender's office technician/paralegal**

My lead attorney, Marc Robert, was NOT present at this meeting.

At this meeting, I presented a **posterboard exhibit** that had been prepared by the Federal Public Defender's office. The posterboard displayed:

1. Archive.org screenshots of the OfficeMax MaxPerks website
2. The "add receipt" webpage
3. The exact text stating users could **"enter the numbers for a transaction you did not make with your rewards card"**
4. Timestamps from Archive.org proving this was the live website during 2009-2011

I explained that this evidence proved OfficeMax explicitly authorized the conduct the government was calling fraud. I expected this posterboard to be used during cross-examination of the government's key witness (Gardner from OfficeMax) the following morning.

### The Morning of January 19, 2016

Before court resumed, John Robbenhaar informed me he would **NOT** be using the posterboard exhibit.

I objected strenuously. I told him this was the core of my defense - that OfficeMax's own website authorized what I did.

Robbenhaar refused.

He said he would instead make an argument comparing OfficeMax's terms to Apple's Terms of Service - that nobody reads these things.

I told him this was a terrible substitute. The Apple argument is vague and general. The posterboard showed **specific, concrete evidence** that OfficeMax authorized the exact conduct I was charged with.

He proceeded with his approach anyway.

### What Happened in Court

During cross-examination of Gardner, Robbenhaar attempted to introduce **Defense Exhibit R** - but this was the **WRONG exhibit**. It showed the MaxPerks signup screen, NOT the "add receipt" page with the permission language.

Gardner refused to authenticate it. The judge ruled Robbenhaar couldn't admit it.

Robbenhaar then attempted the "Apple Terms of Service" argument. The government immediately objected. Robbenhaar dropped the argument.

**The permission language - "enter the numbers for a transaction you did not make with your rewards card" - was NEVER presented to the jury.**

The posterboard was never shown.

The defense I had prepared was deliberately suppressed by my own attorney.

### The Outcome

I was convicted.

I was sentenced to federal prison.

John Robbenhaar was appointed as a United States Magistrate Judge on May 1, 2019 - approximately two weeks before I self-surrendered to serve my sentence.
