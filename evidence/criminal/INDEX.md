# Criminal Epic: USA v. Channon (1:13-cr-966)

## The Case in 60 Seconds

Matthew Channon was convicted of federal wire fraud for activity on OfficeMax's MaxPerks rewards program. The catch: **OfficeMax's own website explicitly told users they could "enter the numbers for a transaction you did not make with your rewards card."**

His defense attorney had Archive.org screenshots proving this. A posterboard exhibit was prepared. The night before cross-examination, the attorney saw it.

**The next morning, he refused to use it.**

Instead, he made a weak "Apple Terms of Service" argument that was immediately objected to and dropped. The permission language never reached the jury. Channon was convicted and sent to prison.

His co-defendant wife got probation.

The attorney who refused to present the evidence was later appointed as a federal magistrate judge.

## The Question

If a company's website explicitly tells you that you can do something, and you do it, and the government prosecutes you for fraud, and your own attorney refuses to show the jury the website...

**Is that justice?**
