# Document 01: The Ghost Physician

## Facility
Central Desert Behavioral Health, Albuquerque, NM

## Dates
August 30 - September 9, 2025 (11 days)

---

## The Billing

**Dr. Reuben Sutter** is listed as the attending physician for the patient's entire 11-day psychiatric detention.

His name appears on:
- Admission documentation
- Treatment plans
- Billing records
- Discharge paperwork

---

## The Reality

Dr. Sutter:
- ❌ Never met the patient
- ❌ Never examined the patient
- ❌ Never reviewed the patient's chart (confirmed by EHR audit log)
- ❌ Never wrote a progress note
- ❌ Never made a treatment decision

**The patient was detained in a locked psychiatric facility for 11 days without ever being seen by a physician.**

---

## Who Actually Provided Care

**Barnie Rodriguez, PA-C** performed all clinical work:
- Admission assessment
- Medication orders
- Daily evaluations
- Discharge planning

However, a PA cannot:
- Independently admit patients to a psychiatric facility
- Order psychotropic medications without physician supervision
- Serve as the sole provider for involuntary psychiatric detention

**Federal regulation 42 CFR § 482.61(c) requires:**
> "A physician must examine the patient within 24 hours after admission [to psychiatric hospital]."

This requirement was violated.

---

## The Fraud

If a facility bills Medicare/Medicaid for physician services, but no physician provides those services, that is healthcare fraud.

If a facility lists an attending physician to satisfy regulatory requirements, but that physician never participates in care, that is documentation fraud.

**This is not negligence. This is a systematic scheme.**

# Document 02: Mass-Signed Orders

## Source
EHR Audit Log, Central Desert Behavioral Health

---

## The Evidence

**Rene Gonzalez, MD** (listed as referring physician) electronically signed **52 orders** at **4:00 AM on September 1, 2025**.

The EHR audit log confirms:
- All 52 signatures occurred within minutes
- Dr. Gonzalez did not access the patient's chart before signing
- Dr. Gonzalez had no documented contact with the patient during the 11-day detention

---

## What This Means

A physician signing 52 orders at 4am without accessing the chart is not providing medical care. This is:

1. **Rubber-stamping** - Signing whatever the PA puts in front of him
2. **Billing fraud** - Creating documentation to support charges
3. **Regulatory evasion** - Making it appear a physician is supervising when none is

---

## The Pattern

| Provider | Role Listed | Actual Involvement |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Dr. Sutter | Attending | Never met patient |
| Dr. Gonzalez | Referring | Mass-signed orders at 4am, no chart access |
| Rodriguez, PA-C | (unlisted) | Provided all actual care |

# Document 03: "In Case He Wants to Flee"

## Source
Physician order, Rust Medical Center
Author: Stephen Corriz, DO
Date/Time: August 29, 2025, 4:27 PM

---

## The Order

> "Will place olanzapine IM in case he gets severely paranoid and wants to flee."

---

## Analysis

### This is Not a Medical Order

Medical orders for PRN (as-needed) medications specify:
- Clinical indication (agitation, psychosis, etc.)
- Dosage parameters
- Monitoring requirements

This order specifies **"wants to flee"** - which is not a medical condition. It is a custody concern.

### Olanzapine is Not a Restraint Tool

Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication used to treat:
- Schizophrenia
- Bipolar disorder
- Acute psychosis

It is not approved for:
- Preventing patients from leaving
- Sedating patients for staff convenience
- Custody purposes

### The Patient Had a Medical Condition

At the time of this order, the patient had:
- Sodium 126 (hyponatremia - low)
- Tachycardia
- Recent drug interaction (retatrutide, tesofensine, caffeine)

These are **medical** conditions requiring medical treatment - not psychiatric sedation.

---

## The Question

If a hospital orders sedating medication not because a patient is psychotic, but because he might try to leave...

Is that medicine, or imprisonment?

# Document 04: US Marshals Interrogation

## Location
Central Desert Behavioral Health, Albuquerque, NM

## Date
September 5, 2025

---

## What Happened

While involuntarily detained in a psychiatric facility, the patient was interrogated by **United States Marshals**.

The interrogation occurred:
- ❌ Without Miranda warning
- ❌ Without counsel present
- ❌ In full view of staff and other patients (public humiliation)
- ❌ Without a physician or patient advocate present

---

## The Alleged Basis

The Marshals told facility staff they were "pursuing stalking charges" based on text messages the patient sent on August 29, 2025.

Those text messages were sent:
- While the patient was in medical crisis
- After being refused emergency care at PresNow urgent care
- While experiencing effects of forced psychiatric medications from NW Texas
- While believing he was going to die

The texts asked contacts to notify the FBI about his medical situation. This is protected speech, not stalking.

---

## The Facility's Role

Central Desert:
- Allowed law enforcement access to a psychiatric patient
- Did not require a warrant
- Did not notify patient's family or attorney
- Did not provide a patient advocate
- Did not document the interrogation in medical records

---

## The Aftermath

Following the interrogation:
- Patient was medically cleared for discharge on **September 6**
- Patient was held until **September 9**
- Reason documented: "pending instruction" from law enforcement

**The facility held a patient for 3 extra days at law enforcement's request, not for medical reasons.**

---

# Document 05: Held Past Medical Clearance

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| September 5, 2025 | US Marshals interrogation |
| September 6, 2025 | Provider documents: patient medically cleared for discharge |
| September 7, 2025 | Patient still detained |
| September 8, 2025 | Patient still detained |
| September 9, 2025 | Patient finally discharged |

---

## The Documentation

Medical records show the patient was cleared for discharge on September 6, 2025.

No new medical indication for continued detention appears after this date.

The only explanation in the records for the 3-day delay: **"pending instruction"** - referring to the US Marshals.

---

## Legal Analysis

### Involuntary Psychiatric Detention Requires:
1. Mental illness AND
2. Danger to self or others AND
3. Inability to make treatment decisions

### By September 6:
- Patient was medically stable
- Patient was cleared for discharge
- No psychiatric emergency existed

### What Happened Instead:
The facility continued to hold the patient - not for medical reasons, but because law enforcement asked them to.

**This is false imprisonment.**

---

## The Question

If a hospital holds a patient after he's medically cleared, because law enforcement tells them to...

Is the hospital providing care, or acting as an unlicensed jail?
