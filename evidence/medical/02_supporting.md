# Document 06: Dangerous Sodium Overcorrection

## Facility
Rust Medical Center, Rio Rancho, NM

## Date
August 29, 2025

---

## The Lab Values

| Time | Sodium Level | Change |
|------|--------------|--------|
| ~3:00 PM (admission) | 126 mEq/L | - |
| ~1:00 AM (next day) | 140 mEq/L | +14 mEq/L in ~10 hours |

---

## Why This Is Dangerous

### Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS)

When sodium is corrected too quickly, the brain cannot adjust. This can cause:
- Permanent brain damage
- Paralysis
- Locked-in syndrome
- Death

### Safe Correction Rate

Medical guidelines recommend:
- Maximum 8-10 mEq/L increase in first 24 hours
- Maximum 18 mEq/L increase in first 48 hours

### What Happened

The patient's sodium increased **14 mEq/L in approximately 10 hours** - exceeding safe limits.

---

## Contributing Factors

The patient was:
- Given no IV fluids at NW Texas despite documented dehydration
- Allowed to drink excessive water due to severe thirst (polydipsia)
- Not monitored for sodium overcorrection
- Transferred to psychiatric facility the next morning

# Document 07: Wrong Patient's X-Ray

## Source
Medical records, Rust Medical Center

---

## The Finding

The patient's medical record contains a chest X-ray showing a **sternotomy scar** (surgical opening of the chest/breastbone).

The patient has never had chest surgery. He has no sternotomy scar.

**This X-ray belongs to a different patient.**

---

## Implications

1. **Wrong patient's imaging in the record** - a serious medical records error
2. **Potential for misdiagnosis** - if a provider relied on this X-ray
3. **HIPAA violation** - another patient's protected health information in the wrong record
4. **Pattern of documentation failures** - consistent with other irregularities

# Document 08: $2,965.90 Ambulance Bill

## Service
Rio Rancho EMS transport

## Date
August 29, 2025

## Distance
1.3 miles (from fall location to Rust Medical Center)

---

## The Charges

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| ALS Emergency Transport | $X,XXX.XX |
| Mileage | $X.XX |
| Supplies/Medications | $XXX.XX |
| **Total** | **$2,965.90** |

---

## The Questions

### 1. Was ALS (Advanced Life Support) Warranted?

The patient was:
- Conscious
- Ambulatory before transport
- Willing to enter ambulance voluntarily
- Not in cardiac or respiratory distress

ALS billing requires specific medical criteria. Were they met?

### 2. The Midazolam Mystery

The patient recalls the EMT saying "I'm going to give you some midazolam."

Midazolam is a sedative. If administered, it must be documented.

**Rust Medical Center's records contain no mention of midazolam administration.**

If midazolam was given but not documented:
- The receiving hospital treated the patient without knowing he was sedated
- Symptoms attributed to "psychosis" may have been drug effects
- This is a dangerous documentation failure

### 3. Ghost Nurse

The EMS records reference **"Lucy H/LHS"** as a nurse.

No nurse by this name appears in other facility documentation.

# Document 10: Consent Form Timestamp Analysis

## The Problem

Medical consent forms require:
- Patient signature
- Date and time of signature
- Witness signature (often)

Several consent forms in the Central Desert records show timestamps that are **impossible** or **suspicious**.

---

## Examples

[Specific examples to be added with actual document references]

### Pattern 1: Pre-Arrival Signatures
Forms signed/dated before the patient arrived at the facility.

### Pattern 2: Backdated Forms
Forms with creation metadata showing they were generated after the date written on the form.

### Pattern 3: Batch Signatures
Multiple forms with identical timestamps suggesting batch processing rather than individual consent.

---

## Why This Matters

If consent forms are signed after procedures occur, there was no informed consent.

If consent forms are backdated, that is document fraud.

If consent forms are fabricated, that is healthcare fraud.

**The patient cannot have consented to treatment before arriving at the facility.**
