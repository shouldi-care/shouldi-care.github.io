# Medical Epic: Ghost Physicians and Fabricated Records (August-September 2025)

## The Case in 60 Seconds

A patient arrives at multiple hospitals with documented electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hypokalemia) and tachycardia - treatable medical conditions.

Instead of treatment, he receives:
- Involuntary psychiatric commitment
- Forced antipsychotic medications that worsen his condition
- 11 days detained at a facility where the "attending physician" never examined him
- Interrogation by US Marshals inside the psychiatric unit - no Miranda, no counsel
- Held 3 days past medical clearance "pending instruction" from law enforcement

The medical records reveal:
- **Ghost physicians** billing for care they never provided
- **Consent forms** signed before the patient arrived
- **Mass-signed orders** (52 at 4am by a doctor who never accessed the chart)
- **A PA practicing beyond scope** as the only actual clinician

## What To Look For

1. **Was there physician oversight?** Read `01_ghost-physician.md` and `02_mass-signed-orders.md`
2. **Was this medical care or custody?** Read `03_flee-order.md`
3. **Was law enforcement involved inappropriately?** Read `04_usms-interrogation.md`
4. **Was he held legally?** Read `05_held-past-clearance.md`

## The Question

If a hospital bills Medicare for physician services, but no physician ever examines the patient...

If a patient is held in a locked facility for 11 days with no actual medical supervision...

If law enforcement interrogates that patient without counsel, and the facility helps...

**Is that healthcare, or something else?**
