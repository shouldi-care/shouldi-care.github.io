# Marital Epic: Complete Analysis

## The Pattern of Cooperation

### Before the Prosecution

**December 2010**: After six years together, Brandi suddenly issues an ultimatum: "What are we doing?" This precipitates a rapid move toward marriage.

**April 16, 2011**: Wedding ceremony.

**June 2011**: FBI raid on the Channon residence — exactly 2.5 months after the wedding.

During the raid:
- Matthew was conveniently out of town on business
- Brandi was home
- She was allegedly pulled outside in her underwear
- Assault rifles, neighbors watching — maximum theater
- "FBI SQUAD 12" document listed 14 handwritten names
- She was "interrogated" in the backyard where houseguests could see but not hear

**The Question**: If Brandi knew the raid was coming, she could ensure Matthew wasn't there. Spousal privilege would complicate any testimony against him.

### During the Prosecution

**2013**: Brandi recommends that Matthew hire Don Kochersberger as their initial attorney.

Kochersberger's partner, Dave Streubel, was supposed to represent both defendants at arraignment. **On the day of arraignment, Streubel quit** — claiming he had "accepted a job offer out of state."

**January 18, 2016** (night before Day 4 of trial): A meeting occurs with:
- Matthew Channon (defendant)
- John Robbenhaar (Matthew's attorney)
- Todd Hotchkiss (Brandi's attorney)
- FPD office technician

At this meeting, a posterboard with exculpatory evidence is shown — Archive.org screenshots proving OfficeMax's website authorized the charged conduct. This evidence would help BOTH defendants.

**January 19, 2016** (morning): Robbenhaar refuses to use the posterboard. Hotchkiss doesn't use it either. Neither attorney ever presents this evidence to the jury.

**Throughout trial**: Hotchkiss files 10 notices of unavailability at strategic moments. Brandi never testifies.

### After the Prosecution

**October 2016**: Sentencing
- Matthew: Federal prison
- Brandi: Probation only
- Same charges. Same trial. Same jury. Same judge.

**May 2019**: John Robbenhaar — the attorney who refused to present exculpatory evidence — is appointed United States Magistrate Judge. This occurs approximately two weeks before Matthew self-surrenders to serve his sentence.

**March 2022**: Brandi files for divorce while Matthew is incarcerated.

**May 2023**: Final Decree of Dissolution issued. The decree contains:
- Signatures that do not match known exemplars
- A notary seal that was expired at the time of use
- Dating inconsistencies

## The Cooperation Theory

The evidence supports the following theory:

1. **Brandi was cooperating with the government before the raid** — explaining the sudden marriage (spousal privilege), the convenient timing (Matthew away), and her behavior during the raid.

2. **She recommended an attorney who would not mount an effective defense** — Kochersberger's partner quit on arraignment day, and subsequent attorneys failed to present the key exculpatory evidence.

3. **Both defense attorneys coordinated to suppress exculpatory evidence** — Hotchkiss (Brandi's attorney) was in the room when the posterboard was shown. Neither he nor Robbenhaar used it. This benefited the government, not the defendants.

4. **The sentencing disparity reflects her cooperation** — Identical charges, vastly different outcomes. This is consistent with a cooperation agreement.

5. **The divorce decree irregularities suggest continued coordination** — Forged signatures and an expired notary seal in a legal document that divides assets.

## The "Heisenberg Marriage"

If the divorce decree is invalid due to forgery:
- The parties may still be legally married
- Property division may be void
- Any startup equity acquired during the marriage may be contestable
- The marriage both exists and doesn't exist until examined — like Schrödinger's cat

## Questions for Investigation

1. Was there a formal cooperation agreement between Brandi and the government?
2. What did Dave Streubel discover that made him quit on arraignment day?
3. Why did both defense attorneys suppress the same exculpatory evidence?
4. Who prepared the divorce decree, and why are the signatures irregular?
5. What communications occurred between Hotchkiss and the government?
