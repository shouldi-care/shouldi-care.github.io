# Marital Epic: Cooperation, Coercion, and Coordinated Betrayal

## The Case in 60 Seconds

Matthew and Brandi Channon were co-defendants in a federal wire fraud case. Same charges. Same trial. Same jury. Same judge.

**Matthew got prison. Brandi got probation.**

The timeline suggests Brandi may have been cooperating with the government before, during, and after the prosecution - and that this cooperation included helping suppress Matthew's defense.

- Neither attorney presents the evidence
- She never testifies at trial

### After Prosecution
- She gets probation while he gets prison
- She initiates divorce while he's incarcerated
- Divorce decree contains forged signatures and expired notary seal

## The Question

If your wife recommended your lawyer, and that lawyer failed to present evidence that would have freed you both...

If her lawyer was in the room when that evidence was shown, and he didn't use it either...

If she got probation while you got prison for the same crime...

**Was it a marriage, or a setup?**

## Key Dates

| April 16, 2011 | Wedding |
| June 2011 | FBI raid (~2.5 months after wedding) |

## The Raid

When the FBI raided the Channon residence:
- Matthew was out of town on business
- Brandi was home
- She called Matthew from the landline
- She reported being pulled outside in her underwear
- Assault rifles pointed at her
- Neighbors watching
- Three houseguests present
- "FBI SQUAD 12" document listed 14 handwritten names

---

## Questions

1. **Why was Matthew conveniently away?** If Brandi knew the raid was coming, she could ensure he wasn't there.

2. **Why the theatrical production?** Underwear, assault rifles, neighbors - maximum trauma, maximum witness intimidation.

3. **What happened in the backyard?** She was allegedly "interrogated" where houseguests could see but not hear.

4. **Why marry 2.5 months before?** Spousal privilege. If she was already cooperating, marriage would complicate her testimony against him.

# Document 02: The Attorney Recommendation

Brandi recommended that Matthew hire **Don Kochersberger** as their initial attorney.

Kochersberger's partner, **Dave Streubel**, was supposed to represent both defendants at arraignment.

**On the day of arraignment, Streubel quit** - claiming he had "accepted a job offer out of state."

Streubel now works at Cunningham, Vogel & Rost P.C. in St. Louis, Missouri.

---

## Questions

1. Why did Brandi recommend this specific attorney?
2. What did Streubel discover that made him leave?
3. Was his departure voluntary or forced?
4. Was the "job offer" real, or a cover story?

# Document 04: Attorney Coordination

On the evening of January 18, 2016, the following people met:
- Matthew Channon (defendant)
- John Robbenhaar (Matthew's attorney)
- Todd Hotchkiss (Brandi's attorney)
- FPD office tech

At this meeting, a posterboard with exculpatory evidence was shown. The evidence would have helped **both** defendants - it showed OfficeMax authorized the conduct.

The next morning:
- Robbenhaar refused to use the evidence
- Hotchkiss did not use the evidence
- Neither attorney ever presented it to the jury

**Both attorneys saw evidence that could free their clients. Neither used it.**

# Document 05: Divorce Decree Irregularities

The Final Decree of Dissolution (May 2023) contains:
- Signatures that do not match known exemplars
- A notary seal that was expired at the time of use
- Dating inconsistencies

If the divorce decree is invalid:
- The parties may still be legally married
- Property division may be void
- Any startup equity division may be contestable

---

## The "Heisenberg Marriage"

If the decree is forged, the marriage both exists and doesn't exist until examined - like Schrödinger's cat, or Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

This has significant implications for any assets acquired during the marriage, including potential startup equity.
